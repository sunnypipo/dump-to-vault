# dump-stash
A CLI tool that converts files (PDF, DOCX, images) into Markdown and writes them to an output folder. Runs on proot-Ubuntu via Termux on Android.
---
## Why use this

Most AI chat interfaces (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) accept PDF uploads, but they read the file themselves you don't control how much of it they use. dump-stash converts your files to markdown first, so you can paste the readable text directly into the chat.

meaning:
- no skipped pages
- images and scanned PDF's text becomes selectable text
- you can paste text directly on chatbox
---
## Limitations
The output is not always clean. Depending on the source file

you may get:
- garbled or missing text from scanned PDFs with low-quality scans
- broken table formatting from complex multi-column layouts
- OCR not recognizing text in handwritten notes or stylized fonts
- Stray characters, broken line breaks or random characters appearing in the output
---
If the markdown looks messy, just send it to an AI to clean up before using it.
> example:
> "Clean up this Markdown. Fix broken formatting, remove repeated headers and footers, and make it readable. Don't change the actual content."

>then, paste the raw .md output

## Supported formats
`PDF` `DOCX` `PNG` `JPG` `JPEG` `WEBP` `TIFF` `BMP` `GIF`
---
## Prerequisites
- Android phone with Termux installed (from F-Droid, not Play Store)
- At least 2GB of free storage
---
## Step 1 — Set up Termux storage
Run this in Termux and allow storage permission when Android prompts:
```bash
termux-setup-storage
```
Verify it worked:
```bash
ls ~/storage/shared
```
>You should see your Android shared storage folders.
---
## Step 2 — Install proot-distro
```bash
pkg update
pkg install proot-distro
```
Install Ubuntu:
```bash
proot-distro install ubuntu
```
---
## Step 3 — Set up login alias with storage mount
This makes storage accessible inside proot every time you log in:
```bash
echo "alias ubuntu='proot-distro login ubuntu --bind /sdcard:/root/storage/shared'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
Log into proot:
```bash
ubuntu
```
Verify storage is mounted:
```bash
ls /root/storage/shared/Documents
```
---
## Step 4 — Set up your folders
Inside proot, create the folders on Android shared storage:
```bash
mkdir -p /root/storage/shared/Documents/dump
mkdir -p /root/storage/shared/Documents/output
```
> **Note:** This step is optional. If you skip it and don't set `INPUT_FOLDER` / `OUTPUT_FOLDER` in Step 6, dump-stash will default to using `./dump` and `./output` inside the cloned project folder instead.
---
## Step 5 — Clone and install
```bash
apt install git
git clone https://github.com/sunnypipo/dump-stash
cd dump-stash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
The installer will:
- Install system dependencies (tesseract, pandoc, ghostscript)
- Create a Python virtual environment
- Install Python dependencies
- Create the dump and output folders
---
## Step 6 — Configure paths
```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```
Set your paths:
```bash
INPUT_FOLDER= /root/storage/shared/Documents/dump
OUTPUT_FOLDER= /root/storage/shared/Documents/output
```
>Save with `Ctrl+X` → `Y` → `Enter`.
---
## Step 7 — Run
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python stash.py
```
> **Note:** The venv only stays active for your current terminal session. If you close Termux, exit proot, or deactivate the venv, you'll need to reactivate it before running the script again:
> ```bash
> cd dump-stash
> source .venv/bin/activate
> python stash.py
> ```
---
## Usage
Drop files into your dump folder and run the script:
```
/sdcard/Documents/dump/Math - Derivatives.pdf
/sdcard/Documents/dump/photo.jpg
```
Converted files will appear in your output folder with the same filename stem:
```
/sdcard/Documents/output/Math - Derivatives.md
/sdcard/Documents/output/photo.md
```
The original source files are moved into `dump/double_dumped/` after a successful conversion:
```
/sdcard/Documents/dump/double_dumped/Math - Derivatives.pdf
/sdcard/Documents/dump/double_dumped/photo.jpg
```
---
## What happens to processed files
| Result | Action |
|---|---|
| Converted successfully | `.md` written to `OUTPUT_FOLDER`; original moved to `dump/double_dumped/` |
| Duplicate output already exists | skipped before conversion runs; reason printed at end of run |
| Failed | skipped; original left in `dump/`; reason printed at end of run |
---
## Warnings you can ignore
When running the script you may see messages like:
```
GPU device discovery failed: Permission denied
pthread_setaffinity_np failed
```
These are harmless proot cannot access Android GPU or low-level CPU scheduling. Your files will still be processed correctly.
